# one-stop-shop-returns-journey-tests
UI test suite for the `one-stop-shop-returns-frontend` using WebDriver and `<scalatest/cucumber>`.

## Running the tests

Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:
- Docker - to run mongo and browser (Chrome, Firefox or Edge) inside a container - see guide here - https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/developer-set-up/install-docker.html
- Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager).
- Selenium Grid - see section further down

Run the following commands to start mongo and services locally:

    Run mongo at 4.4 with a replica set:
    docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongo4 mongo:4.4 --replSet rs0
    
    Connect to said replica set:
    docker exec -it mongo4 mongo

    When that console is there:
    rs.initiate()

    Start services via service manager:
    sm2 --start ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL 

Then execute the `run_tests.sh` script:

    ./run_tests.sh <browser-driver> <environment> 

The `run_tests.sh` script defaults to using `chrome` in the `local` environment.  For a complete list of supported param values, see:
- `src/test/resources/application.conf` for **environment**

## Selenium Grid

You will need to run Selenium Grid via the instructions here - https://github.com/hmrc/docker-selenium-grid

## ZAP and Accessibility tests
